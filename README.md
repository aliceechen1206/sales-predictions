# Sales Prediction

***Author***: Alice Chen

**Business problem:**

Understanding the properties of products and outlets that play crucial roles in predicting sales. Based on features of the items sold we will try maximizing the sales of products and determine Items that need sale boost for future sales.

# Methods
- Building a linear regression model
- Building regression tree model
- Using Histogram, Barplot, Boxplot, and Seaborn for exploration of relationshipp between groups.

# Results

**Comparing types of Supermarket/Grocery**

> Majority of Outlet Type are Supermarket Type 1

**Comparing if when the establish year contributes to Item Outlet Sales**

> Graph shows that average sale is 2181.29 and median sale being 1794.33. Based on the data the year does not affect sales though the types of Supermarket/Grocery can contribute to the sales.

# Recommendations
I recommend using the regression tree because the R2 in the decision tree is negative and we should not get a negative on that value as it means that there is something wrong with the model.
